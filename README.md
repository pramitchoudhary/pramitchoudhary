### Hi there, I am Pramit ðŸ‘‹
I am a seasoned Applied Machine Learning Research Scientist/data scientist/Engineer leader.
My expertise is in building Statistical/Machine Learning models(Bayesian and Frequentist Modeling techniques) to help the business realize its data journey. 
Currently work for h2o.ai as the Lead Machine Learning Scientist/Engineer.
- I'm currently leading efforts on LLM2SQL assistant for QnA on structured data using SQL generation, https://github.com/h2oai/sql-sidekick
- Fun project with LLMs for image generation, https://github.com/h2oai/wave-image-styling-playground
- Responsible for Model Analyzer, a unified interactive framework for simulation (What-If scenarios) and adversarial robustness to continuously explore and evaluate predictive model's behavior and limitations.
- Lead the team to build AutoInsights under the guidance of Dr. Leland Wilkinson (Chief Scientist). AutoInsights is an automated self-service AI/ML system designed to discover hidden insights (auto EDA) and publish them as interactive, engaging, and actionable insights using natural language narratives.
- Contributed to improving the model interpretation idea in h2o Driverless AI MLI.
